# Scripts to install Python and modules
When you want to share a Python environment with non-engineers, just a one action should be enough to install Python and reproduce the environment from the requirements.txt file.

## Usage
1. The directory structure must be like this
    ```
    requirements.txt
    install_python_env_for_windows
    ```

2. Double click ```install_python_env_for_windows\install_python_env.bat```.
3. Python version you want and modules in ```requirements.txt``` will be installed.
